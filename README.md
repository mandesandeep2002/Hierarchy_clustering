# Hierarchy_clustering

# **PROJECT TITLE**:
 Analysis and prediction of "Mall_customers".csv of American Mall market called as phonix mall top findout on the basis of Client requirement of Dendograms using Scipy Graphcis Library with the help od"Scipy.cluster.hierarchy",to ace the no.of linkage of Clustering to predict.

#**project statement**: 
 The American Finance market Clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as highest number of growth in their business market.
As a Datascience Engineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future

# TASKS:
1) with help of Scipy Library import libraries and dataset
2) using the Dendogram to find th optimel number of clusters
3) Create a Hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplot library

# conclusion: 
According to the model building as a Engineer my prediction is cluster 3 has highest number of linkage

# Insights: 
 1) Cluster1 contains (red)colour which showsn= that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from centroid upto AnnualIncome Approximately 139K$

 2) Cluster 2 contains (blue)colour which show that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance frdom centroid upto AnnualIncome Approximately 79-80K$

 3)Cluster 3 contains (green)colour which show that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance frdom centroid upto AnnualIncome Approximately 139K$

 4) Cluster 4 contains (cyan)colour which show that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance frdom centroid upto AnnualIncome Approximately 40K$

 5)Cluster 5 contains (pink)colour which show that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance frdom centroid upto AnnualIncome Approximately 41K$
